## We will be using these tools:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for our development environment
If you don't have these tools installed, you can do so by clicking the links for each one above.

### After setting up Node.js for your VSCode, you can now use Node.js to install Vite for your project using the terminal.

### You can now start building your React projects and style them with Tailwind CSS.
